# Add Fields

To add a field to the schema, in your field config UI:

- Navigate to the `Manage Fields` page for your entity type.
- Next to the field you want to expose: Select `Edit`
- Down the bottom select the `GraphQL` fieldset
- Click `Enable GraphQL`

Optionally rename your field in the schema.

> Renaming can be useful for avoiding naming convention conficts and avoid the need for making aliases within your queries.
