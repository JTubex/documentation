# Concepts

A clean schema without excessive meta-spam of cms config.

- Lean schema and types
- Lots of useful hooks
- Overridable plugins
- Customization settings and features

**GraphQL Compose** is built upon the Drupal Plugin API and webonyx/graphql-php. It enables you as a developer to customise and extend and add your own fields, entities and features by using hooks and custom plugins.

## GraphQL **enhances** developer experience

GraphQL should help your frontend developers build a great experience for your users. Frontend developers don't need to know how Drupal works.
