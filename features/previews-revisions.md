# Previews & Revisions

> :fire: Enable the **graphql_compose_routes** module.\

Load an entity revision and previews using the `route()` query and the `route_entity_extra` resolver.

## Previews

This URL is generated by Drupal.

```graphql
query {
  route(path: "/node/preview/316a57af-eb8d-4bc6-8347-7b35970780c8/full") {
    ... on RouteInternal {
      entity {
        ... on NodeArticle {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> :thinking: When you click "Preview" in the Drupal admin interface, it generates a preview URL and stores your entity in a form state. Maybe you could use the preview URL in an iframe or as a redirect on the Drupal admin interface?

## Revisions

This URL is generated by Drupal.

```graphql
query {
  route(path: "/node/2/revisions/2/view") {
    ... on RouteInternal {
      entity {
        ... on NodeArticle {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
